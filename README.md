## Running the program
To run the program, you will first need to [clone or download](https://github.com/Blanxs/LBRYFileUploader.git) it, then on your local machine, navigate to `LBRYFileUploader-master/SlackGroup/dist` 
there, run `java -jar SlackGroup.jar`. Be sure to have the LBRY app open as well. The program will launch and you should be all good.
